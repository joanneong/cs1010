Hello everyone!

Feel free to access and download the slides that I used during the tutorial sessions. 

If you see any mistakes, you can also open an issue and I will look into it.

### How to use
1. Navigate to a tutorial folder (e.g. Tutorial 2).
2. Click on the .pptx file.
3. Click on "Download" to get a copy of the slides.
